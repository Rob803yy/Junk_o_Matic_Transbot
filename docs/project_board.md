# Project Board

This repository tracks new features and cleanup tasks on the GitHub project board. The following labels help organize work:

- `phase1` – foundational tasks for the first milestone
- `phase2` – work scheduled for later milestones
- `doc` – documentation updates
- `infra` – tooling and build infrastructure
- `good-first-issue` – straightforward tasks for new contributors

## Initial Issues

The project board currently includes these starter issues:

1. **Replace binary PDFs with links** – convert the vendor lesson PDFs to web links (`phase1`, `doc`, `good-first-issue`).
2. **Implement `camera_driver_node`** – create a ROS node to publish camera frames (`phase1`, `infra`).
3. **Draft `ARCHITECTURE.md`** – outline the ROS nodes and data flow (`phase1`, `doc`).
4. **Define `PickPlaceAction`** – specify an action interface for object handling (`phase2`, `infra`).
5. **Add a VS Code dev container** – configure `.devcontainer` for consistent setups (`phase2`, `infra`).

Contributors can browse the board to claim issues and track progress.
